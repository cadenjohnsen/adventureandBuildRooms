This folder contains two programs:
buildrooms.c: this program creates a directory containing several rooms with unique names that are classified as a start, middle, or end room. There will be multiple connections coming off of that room and into other created rooms allowing for travel between them in the adventure game.
adventure.c: this program executes a game where the user begins in a starting room and has to find their way to the exit room by moving to adjacent rooms.

To Compile:
chmod +x makefile
./makefile

To Run:
./buildrooms
./adventure
